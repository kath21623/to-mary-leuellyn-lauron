            <h2>A Special Request</h2>
            <p>Dear Ms. Leuellyn Lauron,</p>
            <p>Ever since you became my girlfriend, I never expected to find myself genuinely happy. I've never been this clingy with anyone other than you, and my inner child feels safe with you. Before you, I was living a life that was quite directed, deriving my happiness from material possessions provided by my parents. That's how I became an awful person, intentionally unkind to others. But since you entered my life, I saw it as a gift. I began to see the beauty of my surroundings through your eyes, and your love taught me to respect people and not always be mean. You've shown me how to empathize with others when I'm unkind.</p>
            <p>Thank you, bay, for your patience, for loving me, for everything.</p>
            <p>I love you so much that the thought of losing you tears me apart. I want to take care of you and be with you through all the ups and downs. I love you always.</p>
            <p>I want us to be together, and I want to ask you to be my girlfriend again.</p>
